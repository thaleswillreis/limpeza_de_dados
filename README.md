# Simple Data Cleansing and Transformation Project for BI

This is a simple project of cleaning, translating and exporting data to Excel format to be reworked into spreadsheet format and then fed into a Power BI dashboard.

## Project phases

1. Exploratory data analysis

    * Verification of the general characteristics of the data;
    * Checking for missing data;
    * Checking for inconsistent data;
    * Attribute engineering.
2. Translation of data into Portuguese (PT-BR)

    * Translation of column names;
    * Translation of column data;
    * Change of date format;
    * Changing the separation of decimal places from (.) to (,);
3. Data export

    * DataFrame export to a Microsoft Excel file;

## Technologies Used

This project was executed using the Python language in the Jupyter Notebook format. The Pandas libraries (Loading, Cleaning and Exporting Data), Git (Code Versioning) were used and the IDE chosen was Visual Studio Code, running on Debian Linux.

### Required Dependencies and Versions

The software and libraries used in the projects had the following versions:

* Python - Version: 3.11.5
* Pandas - Version: 2.2.0

**Note:** This project does not contain a **"requirements.txt"** file

## Problems faced

The code may face problems when running using different versions of languages and libraries. Make sure that the versions listed in the "Required Dependencies and Versions" item are correctly installed.

If there is already a development environment with different versions in use on the machine used, a good alternative would be to create a virtual development environment. If in doubt, follow the documentation link.
